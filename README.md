The Logistic Regression model achieved high accuracy, showing it is well-suited for the Iris dataset, which is relatively small and clean.

Standardization significantly improved model performance by ensuring all features contribute equally.

The confusion matrix and classification report confirmed that the model performs well across all three Iris species.

The heatmap of feature correlation provided insights into which features are related, aiding in feature selection or interpretation.

This workflow showcases a complete machine learning pipeline, including data preparation. model training, and evaluation.

Final Accuracy:
Usually around 93% to 100%, depending on the train-test split.
